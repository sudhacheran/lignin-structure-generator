LGS Dataset

Lignin Structure(LGS) Dataset enumerates lignin chains for degree of polymerization ranging 3 to 25 following published monomer coupling feasibility rules. The dataset includes two types of lignin library with 60K polymer structures of milled wood lignin.

- G type lignin structures which represent spruce milled wood lignin structures with 5.7K polymers
- SG type lignin structures which represent birch milled wood lignin structures with 56.3K polymers
