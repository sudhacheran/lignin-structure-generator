# Lignin Structure Generator
Molecular structure simulation tool for lignin macromolecule. Lignin structure generator uses sequence-controlled structure generation approach. Workflow includes folloing functionalities <br>

a) Sequencing of lignin monomers and conditional linkage generation <br>
b) Generating the topological matrices and molecular graph as directed graph representation <br>
c) Converting the directed graphs into molecular structures <br>
d) Validation the dataset against the experimental observations and simulated structures from previous studies <br>
e) Storing the valid structures forming a dataset <br>
