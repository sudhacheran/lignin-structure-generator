# Lignin Structure Generator
Molecular structure simulation tool for lignin macromolecule

Structure of lignin macromolecule consist of several repeating units (monolignols), arranged in random sequences. During polymerization of lignin macromolecule, monomeric phenylpropane units (C9 units) are converted into radical species by dehydrogenation. The lignin polymer is subsequently formed by coupling reactions of radicals.

Lignin structure generator uses sequence-controlled structure generation approach. Workflow includes folloing functionalities 

a) Sequencing of lignin monomers and conditional linkage generation 
b) Generating the topological matrices and molecular graph as directed graph representation 
c) Converting the directed graphs into molecular structures 
d) Validation the dataset against the experimental observations and simulated structures from previous studies 
e) Storing the valid structures forming a dataset
